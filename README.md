Desktop UI Experiment

A personal website experiment where I wanted to see if I could build a UI that acts like a desktop operating system (loosely inspired by PostHog's interface). It's not completely finished, but the basic window management and a few apps are working.
What's in here
Window Management

   - Windows can be minimized, split, and resized.
   - Works sort of like a basic desktop environment in the browser.

The Music Player

Instead of just hardcoding a playlist, this app tries to automate it:

   - Grabs my top recent tracks from the Spotify API.
   - Searches YouTube for each song and pulls the top 5 results.
   - Runs the titles through a basic keyword heuristic to filter out things like live versions, covers, or reaction videos to find the actual song.
   - Keeps the top 10 best matches and plays them through a hidden YouTube embed controlled via the player API.

Piano App: A basic virtual piano. Uses the Web MIDI API, you can play it through the site.

Snake: Just the classic snake game running inside one of the windows.
